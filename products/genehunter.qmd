A hash map based algorithm with fixed sized sequence tokens is used to locate
matching regions. Then, the best match is determined by the match quality
calculated using the local alignment algorithm of Smith-Waterman. Finally, the
organism and gene infomations are extracted from the NCBI taxonomy and GenBank
database. 

GeneHunter is using the nucleiotide and taxonomy databases of <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank" alt="ii">National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> to identify organisms and genes from
DNA sequencer data.
