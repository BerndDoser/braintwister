    "text": "Algorithms in the field of linear algebra are strictly separated into a dense and a sparse world. BlasBooster provides an opportunity to combine these two worlds in a dynamic way by dividing matrices and vectors with respect to their type, occupation and accuracy, so that in each case the most appropriate algorithm can by applied.\n\n\n\nBlasBooster type matrix\n\n\nLet’s consider, for instance, a matrix-matrix multiplication. First, the matrices A and B will be divided into sub-matrices. Then, each sub-matrix will be converted into their ideal representation with respect to their occupation and significance. Typical matrix types are:\n\nMatrix&lt;Dense, double&gt;\nMatrix&lt;Dense, float&gt;\nMatrix&lt;Sparse, double&gt;\nMatrix&lt;Sparse, float&gt;\nMultipleMatrix&lt;Matrix&lt;Sparse, double&gt;, Matrix&lt;Dense, float&gt;&gt;\nMultipleMatrix&lt;Matrix&lt;Sparse, double&gt;, Matrix&lt;Sparse, float&gt;&gt;\n\nHere, the MultipleMatrix is a special, composed matrix type which is comparable to an expression template of a matrix sum. The type MultipleMatrix&lt;Sparse, double&gt;, Matrix&lt;Dense, float&gt;&gt;, for instance, is useful if a matrix have many small entries which can be stored in single precision and only some entries which must be stored in double precision.\nFor the actual multiplication A x B, several multiplications of sub-matrices of different types will be performed and summed up to the the resulting matrix C.\n\n\n\nBlasBooster matrix multiplication\n\n\nIn addition to the direct usage of the BlasBooster interface, the conventional BLAS standard is also supported. Therefore, it is possible to use BlasBooster without any changes within your application by only linking the BlasBooster library instead of the conventional BLAS library like OpenBLAS, IntelMKL, or NVIDIA cuBLAS. Moreover, the special module BlasAnalyzer assess your application with respect to the BLAS usage and reports a summary of all relevant values and timings.\n\n\n\nBlasBooster scheme\n\n\nFork me on GitHub"

    "text": "In the recent decades tremendous progress was achieved in many fields of scientific computing such as machine learning, genome sequencing, numerical simulations, to name but a few. This amazing success was not only made possible by the continuous development of the algorithms, but also by the constant improvement of powerful programming languages and development techniques to manage the complex algorithms. However, many scientific software projects are still hard to maintain or failing because of deprecated programming languages, libraries, or features or disregarded well-established development techniques.\nThe purpose of BrainTwister is in the development and provision of high performance software in the field of scientific computing, while at the same time special emphasis will be placed in the usage of state-of-the art programming language features and development techniques without compromises.\nThis includes for example:\n\nVersion control via Git\nProject management via GitLab and GitHub\nContinuous integration via Jenkins\nDevelopment environment via Docker\nExtensive software testing\nSoftware metric control\n\nThematically, the main focus is at the moment in the development of BlasBooster, a linear algebra library to combine dense and sparse algorithms.\nI hope that my short outlook has made your interest grow to find out more and I am looking forward to received your feedback.\nBest regards,\nBernd Doser"
